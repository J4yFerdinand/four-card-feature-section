## Description

This repository contains my solution to the **‚ÄúFour Card Feature Section ‚Äù** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK).  
The goal is to recreate the feature section with four cards, respecting the provided mockup and ensuring a *responsive* design.

## Technologies

- **Semantic HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Custom properties (variables)
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- *Mobile-first* flow
- Animation with CSS3

## Installation and usage

1. Clone the repository 
 ```
 git clone [https://github.com/tu-usuario/four-card-feature-section.git](https://github.com/tu-usuario/four-card-feature-section.git)
 cd four-card-feature-section
```

## Learnings

- I practiced creating complex layouts with **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** combined.
- I delved into the use of CSS variables to keep the color palette centralized.
- I reinforced the mobile-first philosophy and the importance of minimal breakpoints.
